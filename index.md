# **Welcome!**

I'm excited to share my journey in cybersecurity with you. Here, you'll find my experiences, research, tools, projects, and much more. As a cybersecurity student aspiring to become a researcher and pen tester, I'm dedicated to learning something new every day. This site is still a work in progress, and I'll be adding more details soon. Thanks for visiting, and stay tuned for updates
